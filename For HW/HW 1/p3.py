# The input is an array A of n distinct integers sorted in increasing order. Our goal is to
# return an array B such that B contains the squares of the elements of A, and B is sorted in non-decreasing
# order. Describe an O(n)-time algorithm for this problem and analyze its running time. Example: If
# A = [âˆ’1, 0, 1, 2], the algorithm should return B = [0, 1, 1, 4].
